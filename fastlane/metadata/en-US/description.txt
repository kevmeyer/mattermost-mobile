This is an open source fork of the official Mattermost Mobile app available at: https://github.com/kevmeyer/mattermost-mobile

This version is built without iCloud and without crash tracking (Sentry).
Only use this app, if you are required to do so :)

The source code of the original app is available here: https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile

To use this app, you need a "Server URL" from a Mattermost server. To host your own server go to https://about.mattermost.com/download
